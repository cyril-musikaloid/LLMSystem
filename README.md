# LLMSystem
Building a complex system running LLM

The aim of this project is to embed LLM in a software that will add capabilities to the LLM.

1. A preprompt will define a specific syntaxe for the LLM to be able to ask the software to execute shell command.
2. The software will be able to register preprompt and send them to the LLM when the context needs them.

This is a draft made of python. This project attemps to explore some capabilities of LLM.
